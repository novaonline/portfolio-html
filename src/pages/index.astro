      About
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Emmanuel on paper but Manny in person. I'm a developer at heart
      who started as a full-stack C# developer and discovered a passion for
      making sense of data. Over the years, I've gone from building web apps to
      architecting event-driven systems that process billions of records each
      month, to wrangling and shaping data into meaningful insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days, I'm unlocking data at KORE Wireless to optimize costs and
      increase connectivity transparency. Here, I get to combine my love for
      software, big data, and clean architecture. I'll admit that while I enjoy
      the problem-solving journey, I get even more satisfaction from seeing the
      real-world value it creates.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not architecting systems, you'll likely find me tinkering in my
      homelab or diving into creative projects that blend technology with
      everyday life.
    </p>

      Signature Architecture (Green-field Ideal)

        The Software Architect Elevator: Redefining the Architect's Role in the
        Digital Enterprise by Gregor Hohpe
      </a>
      , A software Architect may have unconscious preferences or tendencies that
      impact their decision-making. Being aware of those biases can help you avoid
      blindly applying patterns that don't fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being transparent about my tendencies can help the people I work with
      understand quickly where I may have blind spots. It's important for me to
      stress that I am fully aware that every organization and project has its
      own unique constraints, and adopting my ideal architecture is almost never
      possible... but I still like to dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      My ideal architecture for a new green-field project is event-driven with a
      very strong streaming governance model and HTTP-based APIs with
      self-generating open API specs. I've read Client → Identity Server → HTTP
      API → Synchronous service with its own database; events flow to an
      asynchronous worker via an event bus; a dedicated integration service
      connects to a third-party.

          Client authenticates with identity server and calls HTTP API. API
          calls a microservice with its own database. Events are published to an
          event bus consumed by an async worker. An integration service connects
          to a third party.
