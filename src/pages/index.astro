      About
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Emmanuel on paper but Manny in person. I'm a developer at heart
      who started as a full-stack C# developer and discovered a passion for
      making sense of data. Over the years, I've gone from building web apps to
      architecting event-driven systems, to wrangling and shaping data into
      meaningful insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not architecting systems, you'll likely find me tinkering in my
      homelab or diving into creative projects that blend technology with
      everyday life.
    </p>

      My Architecture Bias (Green-field Ideal)

      A software architect may have unconscious preferences or tendencies that
      impact their decision-making. Being aware of those biases can help you
      avoid blindly applying patterns that don't fit.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Being transparent about my tendencies can help the people I work with
      understand quickly where I may have blind spots. It's also important for
      me to stress that I am fully aware that every organization and project has
      its own unique constraints, and adopting my ideal architecture is almost
      never possible... but I still like to dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      My ideal architecture is event-driven with a very strong streaming
      governance model and HTTP-based APIs with self-generating open API specs.
      There is a clear decoupling between the product systems, analaytical
      systems, and business systems.

    <p>
      The <b>product systems</b> have a goal to make both the builders and operators
      using the platform happy. Then a feature is built in the user interface, by
      default there is an equivalent public API for the builders. The events they
      emit are all possible verbs you can think of against entities. This makes the
      end users, analytical systems, and business systems happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>analytical systems</b> have a goal of combining and producing observations
      for the end users and internal stakeholders. They consume events and capture
      anything else they need via the product system's API gateways. These observations
      are also emitted as events for other systems. Its important to note that it
      only makes sense for these systems to provide historical, merged or aggregated
      forms of data they consumed. One of the negative side effects of this architecture
      is the possibility of data staleness or inconsistency. Therefore an important
      part of their monitoring is building data quality checks, uniqueness checks,
      monitoring pipelines, and periodic checksum inspired validations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>business systems</b> have a goal to make money. They focus on collecting
      the money, and finding more ways to keep that money coming in. Often, thats
      through upselling and cross-selling, marketing, and optimizing margins. From
      my experience, these systems are often third party systems CRMs and ERP systems.
      They integrate with the product systems via APIs and events and provide feedback
      loops. They also use the analytical systems to strategize and make data-driven
      decisions.
